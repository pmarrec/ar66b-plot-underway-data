Matlab script for plotting underway temperature, salinity and fluorescence in near-real time from the ARYYMMDD_0000.csv files located in the '\\10.100.100.30\data_on_memory\underway\proc\' repository during the cruise. 
Also included a Matlab script to plot on a map the ship track and the sampled station using the m_map toolbox (Pawlowicz, R., 2020. "M_Map: A mapping package for MATLAB", version 1.4m, [Computer software], available online at www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html.)
